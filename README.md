# DNS â†’ ENS Indexer

Index the DNSRegistrar contracts from the Ethereum Name Service to create a subgraph for querying imported DNS records. An API-friendly version of [this Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/queries/3324133).

## How to run it

Install the dependencies (mainly [Ponder](https://ponder.sh/)):

  }
}
```
